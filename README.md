# Communicate intention

Work with this repository to improve the readability of these test cases, by being more explicit about what's relevant for the tests at hand.

## Exercises
1. Refactor the tests in `Tests.cs` so they express intent more clearly
2. Add a new test to validate the case when the name is empty or null (one of them is enough)
3. If you have spare time, play with [parameterized tests](https://andrewlock.net/creating-parameterised-tests-in-xunit-with-inlinedata-classdata-and-memberdata/)
